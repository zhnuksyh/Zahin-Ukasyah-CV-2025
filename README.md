# RESUME_Zahin-Ukasyah-2025
I'm Zahin Ukasyah, a Maybank Scholar and Software Engineering student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Kuala Lumpur (UTMKL) with a deep passion for UI/UX design, Website Development, and Application Development. I thrive on crafting user-friendly digital solutions that combine functionality with creativity, leveraging tools like React.js, Figma, and Ruby on Rails, alongside project management platforms such as Notion, Trello, and Jira.

I’ve held various leadership roles, including Exco Student Welfare of the Student Representative Council at my university, Secretary of Software Engineering Association, and Acting President of Pembimbing Rakan Siswa, each offering me valuable experiences in teamwork, strategic planning, and organizational management.

My technical journey includes working on diverse projects such as MotionHive’s PECE app, SL Sek Integrasi Al-Alusi’s systems, and personal websites like syahfolio, syahplant, and syahtravel. I also designed the MJIIT Lab Booking System prototype, showcasing my dedication to creating meaningful and impactful digital experiences.

Balancing academic, technical, and leadership pursuits has been an enriching journey. As a Maybank Scholar, I am driven by the desire to excel in my field while contributing to the communities around me by developing innovative, user-centered solutions that make a difference.
