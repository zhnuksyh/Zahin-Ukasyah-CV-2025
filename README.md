# Zahin-Ukasyah-CV-2025
Hey, I'm Zahin Ukasyah, A Strategist. I enjoy solving the puzzle of life, where I found meaning in connecting dots and relevance in everything I learnt. My hobbies are pretty boring; my times are often filled with Chess, Jogging, Coding, Calisthenic, Escape Room, Reading, Listening Music, Watching Movies, Precision Shooting and Analyzing Data. 

I'm also into Psychology, Philosophy and AI-relevance findings, especially the thrive in achieving ASI. I think I'm quite approachable haha, so feel free to ask me anything if there's something I did that piqued your interest.

Recently I'm planning to build my own Tech Startup, but I will keep details as a secret for now haha.
