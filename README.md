# RESUME_Zahin-Ukasyah-2025
I'm Zahin Ukasyah, a Maybank Scholar and Software Engineering student at UTM, always drawn to creativity and problem-solving. Whether it's playing chess, lifting weights, or experimenting with futuristic UI/UX designs, I love exploring new ways to blend logic with aesthetics!
