# Zahin-Ukasyah-CV-2025
Hey, I'm Zahin Ukasyah. I'm a strategist who enjoys problem-solving, design, and research. ♟️ I play chess, where every move requires precision—just like in my work as a Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer, and Graphic Designer. I also work as a Research Assistant at my university, diving into data, analysis, and insights to contribute to meaningful projects. 🧑‍💻

Beyond academics and tech, I stay active with badminton 🏸, running 🏃, and weightlifting 🏋️. Music is also a part of my life, whether I’m playing 🎹 or just listening 🎧. I enjoy learning, creating, and connecting with like-minded people, always open to new ideas and collaborations!
